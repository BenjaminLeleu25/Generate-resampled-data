# Generate-resampled-data  

This repository allows you resample hourly (or others) satellite data in NetCDF format into daily, monthly or annual.  
There are 2 different parts:  
- how to use these functions? (explain in a Notebook)
- how to create a configuration file and linked the functions we created before?
The functions are grouped in the repository _climate_monitoring_ and some example in _Notebook_.
